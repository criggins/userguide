Load DynamiX TDE Release 5.6 Release Notes v.1


========================================

New functionality added in this release:

========================================

1.  -  New FC Series Appliances - Two new additions to the FC Series Load Generation Appliances, in 
         addition to the existing three 16GFC Load Generation Appliances. The 6202-32G offers 2-ports of 
         32GFC Ports at linerate, and the 6204-32G offers 4-ports of 32GFC Ports at linerate.

2.  -  New 40G Series Appliances - All new 40G Series Load Generation Appliances, in addition to 
         the existing 1G and 10G Series Load Generation Appliances. The 7102 offers 2-ports of 40GE Ports 
         at linerate, and the 7104 offers 4-ports of 40GE Ports at linerate.

3.  -  NLM for NFSv3 - NLM is the defacto mechanism for file locking for the widely deployed NFSv3. 
         NLMv4 Client emulation is now available to complement NFSv3 testing to create more realistic and 
         advanced test scenarios. 9 NLM Commands are added, along with statistics for each Command, as 
         well as granular controls of these commands such as Block, Exclusive, Offset, Length, and more. 
         The NLM Client protocol emulation is a licensed feature. The NLM Client license is an 
         Add-on license over the NFSv3 Client license.

4.  -  SMB Auto-Credits - Credits was introduced after SMB2.0.2 to enable control of an SMB Client’s 
         outstanding requests, and is particularly important when large payloads or Compound Requests 
         are used. In earlier versions, users have to manually calculate and configure the Credits 
         values when defining an SMB test scenario. Now, a new Automated option is added for the 
         SMB Credits setting, alleviating the cumbersome process of setting the Credits value that is 
         often error prone.

5.  -  HTTP Retry on 503 - Complementing the HTTP Response Handler feature that was added in the previous 
         release, LDX emulated HTTP Clients and Object Storage Clients can now be configured to optionally 
         Retry a Request upon receiving a 503 Response from the System Under Test. Furthermore, users can 
         define Retry-After, Retry Delay, and Max Retries. New statistics are also added for the 
         new Retry functionality.

6.  -  HTTP Pipelining Enhancements - Complementing the HTTP Pipeline functionality that was added in the 
         previous release to utilize the LDX Threads framework to create concurrent "sub-Scenarios", 
         LDX emulated HTTP Clients and Object Storage Clients can now be configured to utilize the 
         LDX Async framework as well to create multiple outstanding asymmetric Requests.

7.  -  MPIO_CONFIG Stats - A new MPIO_CONFIG stat is added to provide users with clearer feedback 
         about the status of the MPIO Configuration. The new MPIO_CONFIG stat is available in 
         both the Charts as well as the test Logs.

8.  -  TDE improvement to enable better collaboration - Central repository of TDE Projects is a common 
         best practice utilized by large team environments. A simple and generic functionality is added 
         that allows 3rd party repository solutions to easily identify whether a TDE Project is currently 
         "in use". In addition, new functions are added to TDE to allow users to easily reload 
         a currently opened TDE Project to receive any latest changes made to the source TDE Project.

9.  -  User Settings Profiles - Usage of Windows Terminal Servers is also a common best practice 
         utilized by large team environments. However, different users have different preferences and 
         Project / Results storage locations. With the new release, users can optionally launch TDE 
         with a personalized User Settings Profile.

10. -  Custom CDB Builder Templates - The CDB Builder is now able to import a set of natively supported 
         SCSI CDBs as a template, and allow users to perform modifications to the template to create a 
         new Custom CDB to use in test scenarios.

11. -  TDE Project Options - Project Options of LDX TDE now allow to configure displaying the timing 
         data in all TDE statistics charts using absolute timestamps. The absolute timestamps represent
         the time the statistics data was collected on LDX appliance. This configuration is available 
         from TDE's View/Options menu. LDX API command-line options were enhanced to also include this 
         functionality when running LDX projects via LDX API and/or exporting LDX statistics data to 
         CSV files. This enhancement is not available for LDX statistics results that were collected 
         using the previous versions of LDX TDE.

12. -  User Parameters Editor - Auto-Fill dialog in LDX TDE User Parameters Editor was extended to 
         include "Clear Trailing Column Data" option. When enabled, this option allows for the next 
         shorter Auto-Fill over the same column to also clear the trailing column cells that were
         previously filled by the longer Auto-Fill.

13. -  NFS Scenario Branching - Branch Control Support was extended to allow logical decisions/branching
         within the Scenario based on the NFS Response Status Code. This extension includes support for
         NFSv3, NFSv4 and NFSv4.1 protocols. For additional information and sample usage (SMB2-based),
         please see "Branch Control using Status Code return" in TDE User Guide (Appendix: Scenario
         Control Actions).


==========================================

Defects remedied in R56, since R54-SP4

==========================================

A-8876 - LDX iSCSI Initiator may use incorrect value in ExpStatSN field when acknowledging
         SCSI Response PDUs that were received from iSCSI Target.

A-8921 - LDX TDE fails to display the appropriate context menu on right-click over the rows
         in User Parameters Editor.

         the ending value of Ramp-Up Load segment and the starting value of the next Load segment.

A-9083 - LDX NFSv4.1 Client may cause the server to return NFS4ERR_REQ_TOO_BIG error by
         transmitting WRITE request of the length greater than the maximum request size
         specified in CREATE_SESSION request.

A-9097 - LDX SMB3 Client may report incorrect number of packets received with SMB Encryption enabled.
